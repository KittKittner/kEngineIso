The core "engine" for this has it's own project, let's see if I remember to make it public and link it here.  If I don't it can be found in the source anyway, though some bits will be missing because I'm unfamiliar with using Github to do it properly.
## What it is
This is a personal project of mine where I build a game "engine" from as bare bones as I can bear to subject myself to.  \
I thought it would be a good exercise for me to learn a lot about engines in general, specifically how images and font could be rendered to a screen, while also picking up some good practices along the way and having a little outlet for some small ideas I have.  \
My ultimate goal (i.e. in 10 years time) is to have this be a cute little game where I can put my fantastical ideas for things relating to, but not exclusively, Dungeons and Dragons with the ideas being OC from my own world that I've built.
## What it (probably) isn't
This will likely never be a completed game. I'm doubtful I'll ever be completely happy with what I make here. \
I also make no promises that anyone will enjoy playing this, or even that it will reach a playable state.  

## TL;DR
Have no expectations and you can't be dissappointed.
